# vim-flash
Draw attention

<strong>leader f</strong> <em>flash</em> -> show the cursor hairs, go to the beginning of the word, and highlight the cursor location.

<strong>leader n</strong> <em>next</em> -> will repeat the last search, additionally centering the screen and flashing

Two main use-cases:
* exaustive searches (mashing leader n a bunch of times)
* lost the cursor - a quick way to say "here I am"
